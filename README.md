# Pavan Gupta's Random Blog

Everything you find here is yours and was written for [Pavan Gupta]'s blog.  No attribution required.  It's simply a place for me to try new technologies and experiment with new things.  This whirl?  [AngularJS], [Gulp], [Sass], and a bunch of other things are embedded into the mix.

### Soon
A bit of [Express] to liven things up ever so slightly.

### Version
1.0.0-alpha

### Installation

You need Gulp installed globally:

```sh
$ npm i -g gulp
```

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/pavgup/pavgup.github.io.git pavgup
$ cd pavgup
$ npm i -d
$ gulp
```

### Development

pavgup.io uses Gulp + Google's Web Starter Kit, and HTML5UP's Aerial starter to get the ball rolling.  To develop, simply spin up a console and run:

```sh
$ gulp serve
```

And then start coding away.  Gulp will continue to update the browser as you save changes.

### Todos

 - Write Tests
 - Add Code Comments
 - Fix favicon problems
 - Build more stuffs.
