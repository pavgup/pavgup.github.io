No attribution required.  It's simply a place for me to try new technologies and experiment with new things.  This whirl?  [AngularJS], [Gulp], [Sass], and a bunch of other things are embedded into the mix.\r\n\r\n### Soon\r\nA bit of [Express] to liven things up ever so slightly.\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n1.0.0-alpha\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nYou need Gulp installed globally:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ npm i -g gulp\r\n```\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/pavgup/pavgup.github.io.git pavgup\r\n$ cd pavgup\r\n$ npm i -d\r\n$ gulp\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Development\r\n\r\npavgup.io uses Gulp + Google's Web Starter Kit, and HTML5UP's Aerial starter to get the ball rolling.  To develop, simply spin up a console and run:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ gulp serve\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then start coding away.  Gulp will continue to update the browser as you save changes.\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n - Write Tests\r\n - Add Code Comments\r\n - Fix favicon problems\r\n - Build more stuffs.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n----\r\nGNU Affero General Public License\r\n\r\n[//]: # (These are reference links used in the body of this note and get stripped out when the markdown processor does its job.
